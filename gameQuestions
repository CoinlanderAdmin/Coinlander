Should we let people burn shard for scales to be added to Seekers they don't own? 


How many scales should a Seeker born from seizing the coin start with? 
Mike: No starting scales for birthed seekers


How many scales should you be able to buy with a single Shard? 
Mike: check with Lawson about art direction. If people want to acquire a lot of scales, we should
increase the number of scales you can get (think of as percentage of total Shard supply).  
More than one for sure. Leaning towards 9 or 16


Winning seeker stats, have 100% dank scales? 
- 100% dank scales
- Max AP
- Uncloaked by default


Summoned seekers, 17-23 per AP
Born from coin, 20-25 per AP
Mike: does not really dig this because he likes there being a Max Strength (sum)
Revisit how to use Sum of attributes/averages 


After Uncloaking Ceremony do Seekers start cloaked still?  
Yes, check with Lawson 


Keepers Mint for Seekers? 
Yes, set aside 30 summons - mint them to the keeepers wallet thru speical method


What is the cost of changing artwork before we implement CLOIN? In general, CLOIN
is kinda hanging in space... 


Trickle seekers out at what price? What birth day?  

Vaults for other assets
- Mike idea: repurchase the released Coin; put it into a vault
