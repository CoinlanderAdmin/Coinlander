Should we pre-bake a delay/activation time into shard->fragments? for example,
we could have it so that sweet release time + 1 week enables the conversion. 
This would give all interested parties enough time to get their shards in order 
and also would heat up the shard market in anticipation of the fragment game.

Should we let people burn shard for scales to be added to Seekers they don't own?
