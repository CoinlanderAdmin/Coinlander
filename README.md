# $COINLANDER 

The Coinlander Project is a community of creative collectors conspiring to conquer crypto’s quintessential question: what will be the most valuable token of all time? 

We are on a quest to bring that token into the world. 
Our method? Play. 

We believe that human collaborative creativity, unlocked in its purest form through social and economic technology, can be the most potent value-generating engine the world has ever known. We aim to prove it by writing **The Epic of $COINLANDER**, together.

The story is told by The Bard, who has told this tale a thousand times, over a thousand bottles.

He sings of an artifact of immense value. The legend, as he tells it, is that the artifact was found in the world’s oldest mine, the source of the genesis block, but it has since been lost to time...

He sings of an ancient guild, the Keepers, who appear to have rediscovered the artifact, trapped under a cryptographic spell, a spell they work in secret to break.

The artifact is called **$COINLANDER**, and it obeys Three Laws:

__*“There can be only ONE.”*__

Only one Coinlander exists. Only one Coinlander will ever exist. It is written; it is programmed in.

__*“It cannot be HEDL.”*__

The Coinlander can only be had by seizing it from its current holder, by force.

__*“It only goes UP.”*__

To seize the Coinlander, one must be willing to sacrifice more than anyone has before. 

*The legend tells of a day when the spell is broken, 
when the $COINLANDER becomes free to possess,
a day known only as The Sweet Release...*
