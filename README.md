# $COINLANDER 

The Coinlander Project is a community of creative collectors conspiring to conquer crypto’s quintessential question: what will be the most valuable token of all time? 

**YOU ARE A SEEKER**

Blessed by the Keepers high atop Mount Gargantua, you have but one one quest: to seize the COINLANDER-- A sacred artifact of insurmountable value, woven from the very chains of the Genesis Block, a spellbound relic that obeys five laws:

**THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE**

Only one Coinlander exists. Only one Coinlander will ever exist.

**IT CAN ONLY BE SEIZED BY FORCE**

The Coinlander can only be had by seizing it from its current holder by force. And rest assured… others seek the power of the Coinlander for themselves.

**AS IT IS SEIZED IT SHALL GROW**

Each time the Coinlander is seized it grows in size, value, and power.

**THOSE WHO HAVE HELD SHALL BE REWARDED**

The Keeper’s blessings are bequeathed upon the Seekers who have held the coin. By taking the pilgrimage back to the Keeper’s Shrine the Keepers shall re-forge the powerless scraps of Coinlander that shed as it was taken from you… so that you may seize again

**ONLY ONE SHALL HOLD IT**

There shall come a day when the Coinlander can no longer grow; upon this fated moment the Coinlander shall be bequeathed to its last and final holder.
